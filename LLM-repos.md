# GitHub repos

- [Mooler0410/LLMsPracticalGuide](https://github.com/Mooler0410/LLMsPracticalGuide): A curated (still actively updated) list of practical guide resources of LLMs. It's based on the survey paper: [Harnessing the Power of LLMs in Practice: A Survey on ChatGPT and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13712) and efforts from @[xinyadu](https://github.com/xinyadu). The survey is partially based on the second half of this [Blog](https://jingfengyang.github.io/gpt). They also build an evolutionary tree of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to trace the development of language models in recent years and highlights some of the most well-known models. They also include usage restrictions and data licensing information.
- [eugeneyan/open-llms](https://github.com/eugeneyan/open-llms): It contains a list of open LLMs available for commercial use that I've used to compile my [list of LLM models](LLM-models.md).
- [RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LLMSurvey): An amazing repo with the original list that I've used to compile my [list of papers on LLMs](LLM-papers.md).
